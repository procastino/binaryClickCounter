#Binary click counter
This is just a project for a binary click counter made with [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/). It has a button and, when it's pressed, it counts one. It stores clicks and has a circuit to preserve the clicks on case of battery discharge or power runoff. As it is today, it can only get to 16 bits, that is 65535 in decimal, but it is intended to expand to a fairly bigger number, so, hopefully, it is still working when we all leave this world, remaining all our clicks as a legacy for the future generations. Of course, components may have to be replaced or expanded during its life, but the objective is to store the real clicks that people contribute to this project, so no "write down the number on a paper and put it on the new Arduino" is allowed.
It uses Arduino, 74hc595 registers for adressing the LEDs and ULN2003 drivers to, well, drive the current of the LEDs.
